## Overview  
Imagine being a student, constantly juggling deadlines, exams, and career uncertainty. You barely sleep, your diet is a mess, and the pressure never stops. One day, you realize you’re not just tired... you’re emotionally drained.  

This isn’t just a story. It’s the reality for thousands facing depression.
